## Steps

### Step 32 - Configuration screen 

We should have a global configuration screen 
  - command line to use for claude code session (by default) 
  - command line to use for terminal session (by default)

All configuration can be overriden at project level 

Meaning we should find a nice way to reuse the same screen in essence when configuring a project 
with the global default show in grey or something, a way to set or unset a project specific value.
